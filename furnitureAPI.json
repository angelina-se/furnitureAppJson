The covering fabric is made from a durable woven polyester blend that adds comfort and subtle pleasure to any room. Each chair is affordably priced, and if you start seeing ghosts, we'll take it back without a hassle. Frailty, thy name is certainly not these teal accent chairs. The Elsinore Accent Chair is wonderfully accented with silver nail heads and a comfort that will make any room a more pleasant place to be."
